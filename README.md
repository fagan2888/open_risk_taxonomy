The Open Risk Taxonomy is a taxonomy (classification) of risk types and associated risk models

The taxonomy is an **open source risk classification framework** developed by Open Risk to support the 
development of a comprehensive and consistent set of open source risk models. You can read more about 
the conceptual approach to the taxonomy in the following [White Paper](https://www.openrisk.eu/WhitePapers/OpenRiskWP04_061415.pdf) .

An interactive exploration of the taxonomy is available [here](https://www.openrisk.eu/risktaxonomy/index.php) .
